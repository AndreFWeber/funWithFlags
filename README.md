This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that lists all countries in the world and share a few informations about them.

The informations were retrieved from https://countries.trevorblades.com/ GraphQL API by using the Apollo service. All modules and styling from the webpage are from chakra UI components.

The live demo is available on Vercel: https://fun-with-flags-tau.vercel.app/
